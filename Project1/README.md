Project Name: 
Library Managment System  (LMS)

TODO: 
Project allows a person to manage a library database by creating new
or updating old books authors and publishers. The information from each will
be stored in List form and then will be written to or will read
from a file. The project is made using java8 therefore the use of 
Lambda expressions will be called.

What I have learned:
Working on this project has provided me an awareness of the what 
a full stacked java developer does. I understand now what is a package
and how placing my java classes in each provides clearity and structure 
to the project I wrote and will write. Additionally, I began to grasped 
the Functional Progaming structure of utilizing Lambda expressions and also
the use of streams.

My goal moving forward is to improve this project overtime as my skills and
experience increases.
